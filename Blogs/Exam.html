        <h1>The Relationship between Data Art, Data Visualisation and Representation</h1>   
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In this essay I will begin by summarising the three readings given. Then I will go on to relate them to data visualisation and data art. Focusing on the relationship between data visualisation and data art, data visualisation and form of representation and finally data art and techno-art.  
        </p>

        <h2>Summary of Readings</h2>
        <h3>Techno-Art</h3>
        <p>
           The first reading expands on how techno-art, which the author defines as “art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies”, can be used to broaden public discourse and discussion of new emerging technologies. Exploring both the controversies as well as the perceived benefits of these technologies in a way that fosters moral, emotional engagement with the subject matter (Roeser, 2016). 
        </p>

        <p>
           The author emphasizes that new risky technology is often met with distrust and misunderstanding, and that this gap can be bridged by artists, who make the technology more accessible and understandable to the masses, specifically on an emotional level (Roeser, 2016). 
        </p> 
        <p>
        Furthermore, techno-art can be used as a sort of testing ground, wherein new technologies can gain mass exposure without
        the risk of them actually being introduced. These artistic expressions of the new technologies can be used to simulate
        the extremes of that new technology and gauge how they would interact with humanity. Again, with all of this being done
        in the relatively risk free, safe space of art. Reducing the need for risky technologies to be pushed to the public
        without foreknowledge of what consequences might arise from their introduction (Roeser, 2016).
        </p>

        <h2>Artistic Data Visualisation</h2>
        <p>
        This reading explores how artists can appropriate scientific tools of data visualisation to make that art that
        encourages an emotional and subjective understanding of the data. Providing a new perspective of the dataset for the
        viewer (Viegas & Wattenberg, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
        Historically, data visualisation has been seen as a neutral apolitical tool for simply representing data as it is. But
        the reading brings this assumption into scrutiny. By showing examples of artistic data visualisations that grow from a
        point of using the visualisation techniques developed in the scientific field to create art that is subjective and
        conveys information in new ways (Viegas & Wattenberg, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
        Whilst the task of defining art itself is a difficult one, the paper creates a working definition for artistic
        visualizations as those which are made with artistic intent and based on data. This definition avoids the shackles of
        beauty and aesthetics in its categorization (Viegas & Wattenberg, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
        All the artifacts given as examples in the reading embody a strong subjective perspective, that forces the viewer to
        develop a different perspective and alternative point of view of the data. Guiding the viewer to some predefined
        conclusion or commentary on the dataset, that may or may not reveal something about our society. The authors make sure
        to emphasize the power of data visualization to express and communicate a subjective point of view (Viegas & Wattenberg,
        2007).
        </p>
        <p>
            Following from this they elaborate that it is not just these artistic visualisations that are not neutral, but in
            general all visualisations (even those made without artistic intent) are not neutral. Arguing that it is important that
            we understand that visualizations can be a tool not just for analysis but for persuasion as well. They can change the
            way people think, see certain ideas and alter their perspectives and values (Viegas & Wattenberg, 2007).
        </p>

        <h2>Theories of Representation</h2>
        <p>
        This reading aims to tackle representation, which is often a complicated and convoluted topic, in a simplified and
        easily comprehensible manner. The first point of understanding the reading touches on is that representation is
        constructive rather than simply reflective. From this it explores the different facets to consider when studying
        representation (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>

        <h3> Representation and Reality</h3>
        <p>
            As stated, earlier representation deals with the construction of meaning. People can sometimes assume that
            representation simply takes that which exists in the world and presents it. But that is not the case, representation
            provides us the contexts and means to shape our reality. The means in this sense are the signs and symbols used in
            representations, for example a word is a sign, or a sound formed in the mouth is also a sign that is used to denote some
            symbol (Kidd, 2015). The word (and sound) “table” denotes a four-legged piece of furniture on which we place objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            And in this way representation creates the pieces of our reality, rather than reality existing before representations
            gives us the means to conceptualise it (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, meaning is constructed through the assemblage of these signs to symbolise a broad variety of ideas,
            objects, and concepts. This assemblage of signs works to construct a narrative and a version of reality, in which
            somethings are presented as natural and others as unnatural or even invisible (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>

        <h3>Representation as Myth</h3>
        <p>
            Myth deals with the connotative meaning of symbols instead of just their denotative meanings. Brought to the forefront
            is the example of Apple’s logo. Denotatively it is simply a fruit. But connotatively it represents, sleek luxurious
            cutting-edge technological products. This connotative meaning is what works to form the myth of Apple (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Myth is what makes signs operate on multiple levels and carry layers of meaning. Furthermore, myth can be used to
            communicate and naturalise certain messages whilst neutralizing others. The reading indicates that with signs we move
            from denotative, to connotative, to myth and finally to the personal and political consequences of these myths (Kidd,
            2015).
        </p>

        <h3>Representation and Visual Communication</h3>
        <p>
        It is often easier to grasp the idea of text and words as signs for symbols given our daily use of language to represent
        our reality. But visual messages themselves operate in the same way, and though visual communication is more ambiguous
        and suggestive, it relies on established connotations and myth to communicate to targets (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
        Key to understanding a visual sign is understanding its presentational context, production context, historical context
        and relational context. Because signs are rarely consumed in isolation, all of these differing contexts work to produce
        the meaning that can be read from them (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
        At the turn of the century, photographs were seen simply as capturing reality as it, but the reading offers that the
        photographer makes choices on framing, lighting, lenses, subject etc. All of which provide space for the photographer to
        express their subjectivity. In this way image to do simply represent reality, but shape and construct it (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>

        <h3>Representation as Persuasion</h3>
        <p>
        A formidably persuasive form of representation is advertisement, wherein the representation is created with the express
        of goal of persuading the viewer to consume and spend money. Advertisements are made to be memorable and entertaining,
        conjuring the desired associations and myths in the viewer to the thing being advertised. These associations and myths
        are often unspoken, and it is in this ambiguity that they garner their power (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>

        <h3>Represenation and Identity Politics</h3>
        <p>
        This explores how certain groups of people have been made visible (or even invisible) through representation in
        mainstream media (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Representation is never neutral; it naturalizes some ideology or world-view. When it is stated that representation is
            political, it is an acknowledgement of the fact that representation exists within a context and a specific historical
            moment and can thus never be neutral (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Given this, the reading goes on to expand on how certain identity groups have been represented in the mainstream. With
            working class people being represented is unthinking, women as objects to be consumed, racial groups as Other (with
            black people in particular being underrepresented in film and television whilst overrepresented in news stories about
            crime and welfare), etc (Kidd, 2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            It is also noted that increased visibility (say for gays and lesbians) has not led to more progressive representational
            forms.
        </p>

        <h2>The Relationship between Data Visualisation and Data Art</h2>
        <p>
            Li (2020) describes data visualisation as the representation of data in a form that is easily comprehensible. Data art
            also seeks to make data comprehensible, but the terms of its comprehension are of an emotional and moral level, as
            opposed to simply analytic. And the second reading gives a good distinction for what can be considered data art and what
            can be considered data visualisation. Put simply the difference between data art and data visualisation lies with
            artistic intent (Viegas & Wattenberg, 2007).
        </p>

        <p>
        Furthermore, data art draws from the practices of data visualisation (specifically of the scientific kind) to form its
        toolbox for expression. And at times it is through the deliberate misappropriation of the rules of data visualisation
        that data art makes a strong artistic vision come to life (Roeser, 2016).
        </p>


        <h2>Representation in data art and visualisation</h2>
        <p>
            Using the information garnered from the third reading about representation, I will in this section, discuss the
            connection between data visualisation and art and representation. For ease I will be referring to data visualisation,
            but note that these concepts can and should similarly be applied to data art.
        </p>

        <p>
        By definition, data visualisation is itself a representation of some symbol, the symbol in question being the dataset.
        With this understanding it is easy to see the connection that data visualisation has to modes of representation.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Visualisation and Reality</h3>
        <p>
            It is easy to assume that data visualisation simply takes data and presents it as it is. But data visualisation
            techniques offer the visualiser choices which enable them to express a certain meaning to be read from the
            visualisation. Furthermore, to make the visualisation easily comprehensible, a lot of summarisation and selection of
            specific data points takes place, this exercise itself encourages a subjectivity that is inherently not neutral. Because
            this visualisation will form the contact point for most viewers with the data, it therefore dictates their understanding
            of the data. In this way data visualisations construct reality.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Visualisations as Myth</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most spread forms of data visualisations is in the form of infographics. Infographics which circulate easily
            across social media platforms to reach multitudes of people. These infographics are created (like any visualisation)
            with a specific message to be communicated. Given their relationship to scientific forms of knowledge, they carry with
            them a great authority in the viewer’s mind.
        </p>

        <p>
            And whatever narrative these infographics spread is then saturated into society in the form of myths. They cease to just
            be conveying information, they form part of a broader narrative and contribute to mythmaking.
        </p>

        <p>
            The authority that infographics and data visualisations carry also allows them have great naturalizing powers. And in
            regard to the data that is not represent, they can make that subject matter invisible.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Visualisation and Visual Communication</h3>
        <p>
            The link between data visualisation and visual communication is an obvious one. But it bears great importance that we
            discuss how the analytical tools provided in the reading for analysing visual messages can be used with data
            visualisations. Context is very important for understanding a data visualisation (Li, 2020).
        </p>

        <p>
            Presentational context, where does the visualisations appear? Is it in a news article, a blog post, a scientific
            journal, a Facebook post? All of these locales come with different connotations and affordances. Historical context, a
            data visualisation can take on a vastly different meaning depending on when we look at it. A visualisation of Covid
            death rates of June 2020 is inspires more panic when looked at in June 2020 as opposed to November 2022.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            And lastly is relational context, what other visualisations are placed near this specific one. This can give clues to
            juxtapositions, contradictions and similarities that are meant to be drawn. For example, an visualiser of countries
            economic wealth compared to their measure of religiosity inspires a reading of the relationship between a countries
            wealth and its religiosity.
        </p>

        <h2>Techno-Art and Data Art</h2>
        <p>
            The relationship between techno-art exists both on a conceptual and physical level. Physically, data art can make the
            subject of its exploration new emerging technologies. This tips the data art into the definition of techno-art as given
            by the first reading (Roeser, 2016).
        </p>
        <p>
            Conceptually, data art and techno-art function on the same set of premises. They both work to broaden public discourse
            and make accessible information and ideas that would not be to the layman. They can bring a new perspective to the
            discussion by engaging with the emotional and moral faculties of the audience. And they create their toolbox from
            existing scientific and technological practices.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
        It is clear to see that data visualisation and data art and tightly entangled in theories of representation. But it is
        also interesting to note the relationship between data art and techno-art. This relationship means that advancements in
        one field can be applied to the other, even on a theoretical conceptual level.
        </p>

        <p>
        Of further interest is the progression that techno-art and data art make from their scientific origins to forms of
        subjectivity.
