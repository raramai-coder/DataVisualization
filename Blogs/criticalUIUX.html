        <h1>Reflection on UI/UX</h1>
        <p>
            The website is about a data visualisation of how movie remakes fared against their originals in terms of user ratings on imdb.
        </p>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>I chose a minimalistic, simplistic layout with minimal clutter so that objects that are on the page stand out. As the dataset is not too complex and does not require a lot of additional information to be read and comprehended, I decided that a layout with minimal text and minimal elements on screen would be suitable. Because the layout is rather ‘plain’ I decided to bring a pop of playfulness and energy through the colour palette.</p>

        <h2>Colours</h2>
        <p>I chose a coral pink, bright deep pink, and dark purple as the primary colours of the website. As I feel that they convey a level of light-heartedness and playfulness that aligns with the data set I wish to visualize. The dataset is not about a serious topic like covid deaths for example, so it makes sense that the colour palette reflects this level of playfulness. And add a layer of intrigue that is not necessarily provided by the simplistic, minimalist layout.</p>

        <h2>Font</h2>
        <p>My first priority with fonts was to ensure that they are legible and dyslexia friendly. So, I chose two fonts that were both minimalistic in appearance but had little flourishes to them that brought character. As well as fonts that were unique enough to give the website a unique brand and feel.</p>
        <p>The website is quite accessible and also colour blind friendly as I ran a test using chrome’s emulator.</p>
