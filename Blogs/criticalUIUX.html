        <h1>Reflection on UI/UX</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        I will be critically analysing the User Interface for my website using the Basic Principles of User Interface Design
        stated on the Studio by UXPin website. The article gives a very descriptive and concise list for these basic design
        principles that I will shortly summarise before going on to gauge how my website performs when measured against those
        basic design principles.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic Principles of User Interface Design</h2>
        <p>
            The most important thing to note about good design is that it centres around the user and what they need to do with a
            product. In the same sense good design in regards to a website or an app revolves around the user and gives them a
            streamlined experience of the app or website (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022).
     
        </p>

        <p>
            Since good design places users at the centre, it is important to know who your users are and what they want to do. Good
            design strives for clarity and avoids anything that will confuse the user or be a hinderance to the achievement of their
            task. Each screen must have tasks streamlined in such a way that it takes as few steps as possible to complete a task,
            and this is made simpler if each screen is dedicated to a single primary focus. With this primary focus being front and
            centre of the screen (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022).
        </p>

        <p>
        Good design is simplistic as this aids it to be timeless. Furthermore, consistent design not only across one’s product
        but consistency with design conventions across other related products reduces friction for the user. And it reduces
        cognitive load as the user no longer has to learn from scratch how to use your product but can rely on existing
        knowledge of conventions and established patterns to guide them. It should have a consistent visual structure that helps
        create familiarity and establish patterns for the user, this again will further help with the reduction of cognitive
        load (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022).
        </p>

        <p>
        Invisibility is key, as good user interface does not call attention to itself by being tricky to use. Feedback is of
        great importance, and it can be in the form of feedback about the location of the user on the webpage, the status and
        future status of taken actions, as well as outcomes and results from actions. Users should be provided with closure at
        the end of a task and a clear indication of what the next step is (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022).
        </p>

        <p>
        Good design is accessible to users of different abilities and familiarity levels. Good design should also be flexible
        enough to work on any and most kinds of devices (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022).
        </p>

        <h2>Application of Design Principles on my own Website</h2>
        <h3>Users</h3>
        <p>
            While I did not specify a specific identity for who my users are when designing my website, I did know what they would
            want to do on my website. That is users primarily want to see the data visualisation on my website, secondary to that
            they should be able to understand the data visualisation and lastly (but not of great importance) they may want to read
            my blog posts as well as see the wireframing and style guide of my website. Using this hierarchy of tasks I designed and
            structured my website in certain ways.
        </p>

        <h3>Navigation to Data Visualisation – Primary Task</h3>
        <p>
        For starters the navigation link to the data visualisation page stands out from other navigation links as it is the only
        one in button form and purple background colour. It stands out and is immediately the primary focus of the navigation.
        So, the user will immediately be drawn to it and see that if they want to go to the data visualisation that is the
        button to click, making the primary task of seeing the data visualisation front and centre.
        </p>

        <h3>Home Page – Secondary Task</h3>
        <p>
        The home page serves to give the user some necessary contextualisation of the data set so they can better understand the
        data visualisation, the secondary task. Upon entering this page, they see movie posters so immediately they are aware of
        the fact that the site has something to do with movies. And then the title of the page and the paragraph give the user
        information about how the data visualisation compares audience ratings of movie remakes and their originals.
        </p>

        <p>
        The one issue with this page is that I am having a sizing issue between how my website looks on live server and how it
        looks on the GitHub server. So, on live server the homepage is non scrollable, and all the images and text are
        immediately visible to the user. But on GitHub the user sees the title and some of the images but has to scroll down to
        read the paragraph and see the remaining images. This is a problem because this added work essentially hides the
        paragraph from the user on first glance and increases the probability that users won’t see it. Meaning that they
        possibly lose out on important contextualisation that is required for them to easily understand the data visualisation.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Visualisation Page</h3>
        <p>
        In terms of the data visualisation page itself, the title at the top is good because it immediately lets the user know
        what they are looking at and then the visualisation right below is the biggest element on the page highlighting its
        importance in the hierarchy of information. Furthermore, no extra or unnecessary elements have been added to the page
        that distract the user from the single purpose of the page. This removes clutter and adds clarity and simplicity to the
        design.
        </p>

        <p>
            The legend on the right-hand side of the page follows the established pattern of supplementary information to figures on
            the page being on the right. This pattern is started on the home page where the movie posters are on the left-hand side
            with the title and contextualising paragraph being on the right-hand side of the page. And this pattern is continued on
            the data visualisation page to ensure that the user’s line of sight and pattern for exploration is not broken.
        </p>

        <h3>Patterns and Consistency</h3>
        <p>
            For consistent design and pattern creation I have outlined how figures have supplementary information on the right-hand
            side of the page. The only page that breaks this design pattern is the design page which has the style guide and
            wireframes. On this page, the figures are on the right with supplementary text being on the left. This is not good and
            is something that I will work on fixing as it breaks established conventions and patterns.
        </p>

        <p>
        Regarding elements and consistency, elements can be one of three primary colours: purple, pink and black. Black elements
        are the most common comprising of text, headings and more. While pink elements are used to signify navigation feedback
        and where the user currently is. With purple being used to highlight the most important elements, currently the only
        purple element is the button to the data visualisation page as that is the primary focus of the website.
        </p>

        <p>
        I consistently use this logic for colouring of elements, and while this might seem to simplistic as to not be visually
        interesting I counteract that with the coral background which bring a pop of colour and playfulness to the website.
        </p>

        <h3>Clarity and Simplicity</h3>
        <p>
        For clarity and simplicity, I have ensured that each page has one primary focus and one only. So, on the home page the
        user simply gets contextualisation information for the data set, on the data visualisation page they view and interact
        with the data visualisation, on the blog page they can see and read blog posts and finally on the design page they
        access the wireframes and style guide of the website. This has greatly simplified the task of designing for simplicity
        of use because now that each page has a primary focus, I don’t have to do a juggling act to direct the viewer’s
        attention between multiple elements and tasks on a single page.
        </p>

        <h3>Minimal Actions Required for Primary Task</h3>
        <p>
            In terms of minimal actions being needed to complete a task, I will focus on the task of going to view and interact with
            the data visualization. The data visualisation regardless of where on the website the user is, is always one click away
            in the navigation. So, it takes very minimal time and effort from the user to reach it.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I see that I must add a ‘top’ button on screens that scroll very far to the bottom as this would make going to
            the data visualisation page easier than if the user has to scroll a long distance back to the top after reading a long
            blog post. Which is what they currently do.
        </p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>
            Feedback on location I s given to the user using pink underlining of the navigation bar page where the user is currently
            situated. I did not want to make the active page be highlighted in button form as that would draw attention away from
            the data visualisation page button. However, when the user is on the data visualisation page there is no pink indicator
            of the page, they are on in terms of navigation. As I had felt that underlining the button as I do with the ithers was
            too clumsy a style choice that did not follow any known conventions. So, I should change the colour of the data
            visualisation button from purple to pink to indicate to the user that they have moved to this page.
        </p>

        <p>
            For feedback in regard to status I should add a placeholder image or animation for when figures are still loading, this
            will help indicate to the viewer that the images are currently in the loading state and that they should expect images
            to show up some time soon. And lastly, I should add effects when hovering over clickable elements to give the user a
            more stand out visual indication that the elements are clickable. Preferably a uniform one across all the pages such as
            a slight size increase. This will include elements such as navigation links and blog cards.
        </p>

        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <p>
            I should also add a ‘previous’ and ‘next’ button to my blog posts to make it easier to navigate between blog posts. As
            currently the user first must go back to the man blog posts page and select the specific blog post they want to go to
            next. This will become tedious the more blog posts I populate my website with. The addition of a footer should also help
            with navigation across pages.
        </p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>
            Finally in terms of accessibility all fonts used are dyslexia friendly and the website is colour blind friendly as I ran
            a test using chrome’s emulator. I have added alt text to all figures on the site.
            I should however improve on my HTML and make it more semantic. Because at the moment I use a lot of divs and that is of
            very little help to screen readers.

        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            I conclude that my website has mostly good user interface and adheres to majority of the basic user interface design
            principles stated in the Studio by UXPin article. There are however additions and corrections I need to make to ensure
            an even better user experience for my website.
