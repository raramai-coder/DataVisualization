        <h1>Close Reading - Overview of Data Visualisation</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This is a critical reading of Chapter 2 of the book Embodying Data by Qi Li. I begin by summarising the important
            points
            covered in the chapter. Then end by giving a reflection of the chapter which includes insights and knowledge gained
            from
            further research on the topics presented in the chapter.</p>
        
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This chapter handles an overview of data visualization and its history. It covers a definition of data, the
            characteristics of traditional data visualisation, what is considered traditional data visualization and what makes
            data
            visualization effective (Li, 2020).</p>
        
        <p>The chapter begins by expanding on the concept of data visualization emphasizing its importance in science,
            communication, and cognition. It is an important part of science in general though it is generally associated with
            computer science. Its role in the scientific world consists of helping to formulate hypotheses, helping to derive
            insights into natural phenomena, understanding large and small-scale data as well as identifying emergent properties
            and
            product quality control (Li, 2020).</p>
        
        <p>Data visualisation is defined in the chapter as the transformation of quantified data into its respective visual
            representation. This representation is meant to exploit human senses to aid in cognition and understanding of the
            data.
            There are two types of data visualization: information (visualization to represent abstract data) and scientific
            (visualization to represent scientific data which is usually based in the physical realm) (Li, 2020).</p>
        
        <p>The transformation of data into information is key to data visualization. As such the chapter goes on to define the
            two,
            stating that data is raw unprocessed information that is void of meaning and significance whilst information is data
            that has been processed to give it use and meaning through relational connection (Li, 2020).</p>
        
        <p>The traditional forms of data visualization that are presented are trees, maps, scatter plots, charts, tables,
            diagrams,
            graphs, waveforms, simulations, and volume visualization. May data visualization techniques are hybrids of these
            traditional forms. With the common characteristics of these traditional forms being readability, recognizability and
            meaning. Any visual representation of data should be legible and readable in order for it to be of any value. The
            recognizability of data helps users relate it to existing information so that they can cognize it better. And
            lastly,
            these visualizations should be presented in ways that people can understand and gain meaning from them (Li, 2020).
        </p>
        
        <p>Seeing as meaning and cognition are important characteristics of data visualization the chapter expands on data
            visualisation and its relationship to perception. With perception being the process by which humans take in the
            world
            and form a mental representation of it to understand it. The perceptual process is very complicated and subjective,
            so
            the chapter focuses on preattentive processing which is an exploration of visual properties which are detected very
            quickly and accurately by the low-level visual system of humans. Preattentive processing has been divided into three
            theories which explain how visual elements get processed preattentively (Li, 2020).</p>
        
        <p>The first is feature integration theory this states that features are registered early and simultaneously whilst
            objects
            are identified separately. Secondly texton theory categorises textons into elongated blobs, terminators and
            crossings of
            line segments. Specifying that difference in textons or their density can be detected preattentively. Lastly, guided
            search theory explains that there are two sensory scanners that perform visual processing using two parallel search
            mechanisms (Li, 2020).</p>
        
        <p>The conclusion summarises all the topics covered earlier in the chapter. An on top of that it begins to touch on
            ideas
            of how aesthetics (though historically overlooked in terms of contribution to cognition in data visualization) add
            value
            to and in fact underpin data visualization (Li, 2020).</p>
        
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>The chapter serves as good introduction to data visualization, its history, traditional forms as well as the core
            characteristics of these traditional forms. There are some problems in the chapter such as the abundance of
            grammatical
            errors as well as the author’s tendency to brush over important complex ideas and simply name drop them as though
            the
            reader ought to understand them.</p>
        
        <p>One such section that suffers from this flaw is the section on the perceptual process, in particular the discussion
            of
            the four theories of preattentive processing. It was only through further research and use of the author’s source
            that I
            could garner a better understanding of what the chapter is trying to explain.</p>
        
        <p>For starters preattentive processing is the body’s way of processing sensory information from the environment that
            takes
            place before the conscious mind is even aware and can give focused attention to a particular thing (Preattentive
            Processing definition | Psychology Glossary | AlleyDog.com, 2022). Narrowing this definition down to focus on visual
            sensory information, preattentive processing explains the processing of visual information as a division between
            early
            detection of simple differentiating features (preattentive) and focused attention which combines features into
            coherent
            objects (Hossain, 2018). All visual processing tasks which can take place between 200 to 500 milliseconds are
            considered
            preattentive (Healey, 2012).</p>
        
        <p>This information brings value to the field of data visualisation because the designer must understand how humans
            process
            visual information in order to leverage this system to best communicate the information they want to convey in their
            visualisation. As meaning communication is central to data visualisation (Li, 2020). Furthermore, understanding the
            hierarchy of how information is processed and how humans search for the information they need is key. It is better
            for
            the designer to design the visualization is such a way that the user can easily spot the information that they need
            to
            know without spending a lot of time searching for it.</p>
        
        <p>Having stated this, it necessitates an expansion of exactly which features of visual elements are processed
            preattentively, these are called preattentive properties (Preattentive Visual Properties and How to Use Them in
            Information Visualization, 2019). The brain actually has specific neurons that detect these specific features
            (Hossain,
            2018). The four visual preattentive properties are colour, form, movement and spatial positioning (Preattentive
            Visual
            Properties and How to Use Them in Information Visualization, 2019).</p>
        
        <p>Difference in colour gives a visual element a unique identifier which makes it easier for the brain to identify it
            even
            among a sea of distractors (Healey,2012). Form is a set of attributes such as curvature, shape, marks, weight and
            spatial grouping, all of these can be used to give visual prominence to specific objects. (Hossain, 2018). It is
            however
            worth noting that difference in form does not necessarily lead to preattentive processing, for example a sloped line
            among straight lines can be processed preattentively however the converse is not necessarily true (Healey, 2012).
        </p>
        
        <p>Movement has been over-used on billboards and internet pop-up ads, but nonetheless it is still a powerful tool to
            call
            attention to an object. Because of its distracting and possibly annoying nature it must be used sparingly and
            thoughtfully (Preattentive Visual Properties and How to Use Them in Information Visualization, 2019). And lastly
            spatial
            positioning, the brain’s ability to perceive an object’s position in space relative to other objects (Hossain,
            2018), is
            processed within a glance and can be used to inform the user of importance.</p>
        
        <p>The decision of which preattentive properties to use and how to use it is fundamental to good data visualisation
            (Preattentive Visual Properties and How to Use Them in Information Visualization, 2019).</p>
