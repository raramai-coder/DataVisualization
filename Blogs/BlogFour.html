        <h1>Critical Reflection of My Data Art </h1>   
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I begin this critical analysis of my data art artifact by defining data art, then giving a description of 
            what my artifact was, my intentions with the artifact. As well as how my artifact incorporates 
            elements of story in it, how explanation and exploration are expressed through it. I further go on to 
list data art artifacts that inspired my work and finally I conclude by discussing the successes and 
failures of my artifact.
        </p>

        <h2>
            What is Data Art ?
        </h2>
        <p>
Defining art is a difficult task, as can be expected so is the task of defining data art. For the sake of 
having a concrete working definition that avoids unnecessary ruminations on philosophy, I will 
define data art as defined by Viegas and Wattenberg in their 2007 paper Artistic Data Visualization 
Beyond Visual Analytics.
        </p>

        <p>
            They define data art as any visualisation of data that is done by an artist with the intent of making 
art (Viegas & Wattenberg, 2007). There is special emphasis placed on artistic intention and the raw 
materials for the art being a data set. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Artifact</h2>

        <p>
            The data set that I worked with was the IMDB film database. From it I acquired user ratings (with 
users constituting of formal critics and regular audience viewers), of original films and the remakes 
based on these films.
        </p>

        <p>
            Given the dataset and my intended message I decided that making a digital visual artifact inspired by 
the film medium would be the best way to go, hence I made an artistic video.
        </p>

        <p>
            I began by creating a C++ terminal run program that would output the title of a film, its original 
rating, followed by the remake rating and a conclusion based on this rating. If the original had a 
higher rating it outputted “The original was better”, if the remake had a higher rating it outputted 
“The remake was better”, and lastly if they had the same rating it outputted, “They were the same 
but still”. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Thereafter I ran the program and screen recorded the terminal output of all the films as video. I 
edited this video in Adobe Premiere Pro to reach my desired artifact. I began by adding a collage edit 
of notable Hollywood film production companies’ intros, to signal to the viewer that what they are 
about to watch is related to the film industry. And then I slowed down the terminal output so that it 
could be at a readable pace. Finally, I put the terminal output in a repeating loop for 90 minutes, the 
average runtime of a Hollywood film.
        </p>

        <h2> Artistic Intent</h2>
        <p>
            Data Art has the characteristic of being made with artistic intention, which is often intertwined with 
commentary on whatever phenomenon the artist wishes to speak over (Grugier, 2016).
        </p>

        <p>
            My intention was to artistically create critical commentary on the modern Hollywood film industry’s 
affinity for producing unoriginal and uninspired remakes, sequels, and reboots. That some have 
termed ‘pure exploitation films’ (Haanaes, 2022). 
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a visible trend of Hollywood overexploiting successful franchises all the while 
underexploring new ideas, concepts and stories (Haanaes, 2022). This means more and more 
resources are being funnelled into making these uninspired remakes that only bring small 
incremental changes to the story. Which is a great loss, for film lovers and audiences, as well as 
passionate filmmakers who have now been starved of the opportunity to tell creative original 
stories. And the audiences who likewise have been starved of the opportunity to experience these 
original creative stories.
        </p>

        <p>
            My intention was to convey that audiences who watch these films enjoy them less than the original, 
critics who see them find them to be no better than the originals as well as to express the 
overwhelming, uninteresting, and looping nature of this imitative design practice. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I set out to achieve this by firstly, showing the viewer the difference in ratings which swayed 
positively towards the originals being better rated in most cases. Signalling to them the magnitude 
of this phenomenon, as they see film after film that this trend is consistent. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, the video loops for 90 minutes going over the same 130 films, with no changes or 
additions to the output on each iteration. This is to mimic how the film industry is outputting 
repetitive content that has no substantial difference from the original. As well as how cyclic and 
uninventive this is. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, when the viewer first plays the videos, the montage of film production intros signals to them 
that what is to follow is going to be entertaining, but they are instead left with a video that loops 
over the same terminal output with no significant entertainment value.
        </p>

        <p>
            All of this was done to express the uninventiveness and frustration of the artist at Hollywood’s 
bombardment of cinemas with uninspired repetitive remakes. Additionally, work focusses less on 
aesthetics and spectacle, and more delivering critical commentary which directly opposes the nature 
of Hollywood remakes. Which place heavy emphasis on aesthetics, spectacle, and nostalgia, over 
having a meaningful story or commentary.
        </p>

        <h2>
            My Artifact as Story
        </h2>

        <p>
            In order to communicate my intention effectively I had to create it through the lens of storytelling. 
Here I explored data storytelling which is defined as the act of effectively communicating an insight 
and a narrative about a dataset through visualisation (Foster, 2022).
        </p>

        <p>
            As with any good story the following elements are key: main character, setting, narrator’s voice, plot 
(Foster, 2022). 
        </p>

        <p>
            In my artifact the main character is the dataset, namely being the ratings of the originals and the 
ratings of the remakes. The setting is the terminal window, where all of this data is outputted and 
my main character shines. The narrators’ voice is present in every conclusion outputted after 
outputting the ratings, such as “the remake was better”. 
        </p>

        <p>
            And finally, the plot. The plot consists of three elements that repeat in a loop. These elements can 
be thought of as the act progression of the story. The first act is when the title of the film shows up 
and the viewer is given an introduction and a context of what is to follow. The second act is the 
rating of the original versus the rating of the remake being outputted. This is the rising action to the 
third act and the climax which is the concluding statement: that the original was better. And this 
starts all over again for the next film being outputted.
        </p>

        <h2>Explanation versus Exploration in my Artifact</h2>

        <p>
            In data visualisation, exploration and explanation of the data set are key to expressing clear and 
comprehensible data driven stories (Thudt et al., 2018). Exploration is the quality of a visualisation to 
provide viewers with the ability to ask, experience and personalise their experience and perspective 
of the data. Whilst explanation is the quality of a visualisation to deliberately communicate the 
author’s interpretation or message about the data (Thudt et al., 2018).
        </p>

        <p>
            In regard to exploration, it is clear to see how a data set that is in an interactive medium can provide 
exploration by allowing the viewer to change the data points in the presentation through filtration 
for example. But my artifact is in the non-interactive medium of video, so exploration is limited in 
that sense. However, due to the large number of film remakes being shown, this allows the user to 
explore different films time and time again, as they process each individual film.
        </p>

        <p>
            My artifact leans heavily on explanation, not only through text but through form as well. Explaining 
that the originals are better through direct communication using text and explaining the looping and 
uninventive nature of Hollywood’s remake spewing practices through the form of the artifact and 
the creative decisions it takes on.
        </p>

        <h2>Inspirations</h2>

        <p>
            The following data art pieces served as inspiration and thinking points for my own artifact.
        </p>

        <h3>Flight Patterns – Aaron Koblin (2009) </h3>
        <p>
            An artistic video that visualises air traffic, representing North American travel communication 
through movement, form, and colour (Grugier, 2016). Similarly the artist used Adobe’s software 
products to create a videographic artifact that tells the story of the data set.
        </p>

        <p>
            I was inspired by how he transformed numbers into visually stimulating movement and colour, in 
way that is hypnotic and could be viewed in a never-ending loop. Building from this I got the idea of 
an infinite loop of sorts to implement in my own artifact.
        </p>

        <h3>Bicycle Built for Two Thousand – Aaron Koblin & Daniel Massey (2009)</h3>
        <p>
            This is videographic artifact that focuses on audio data, wherein 2088 voice recordings of Amazon 
workers who recorded themselves imitating a specified sound are visualised (Grugier, 2016).
        </p>

        <p>
            I was inspired by how the creators used the power of montage to tell a cohesive story, building from 
this I got the idea for the opening montage.
        </p>

        <h3>data.set – Antonio Roberts (2016)</h3>
        <p>
            This visualisation opts away from visualising a comprehensible data visualisation, but rather an 
experience. And the chosen experience is that of overwhelm. With bright highly saturated pixels 
populating the artifact, giving the effect of colourful noise.
        </p>

        <p>
From this I gathered the inspiration of communicating an experience beyond its comprehension, 
which fed into the inspiration of doing an infinite loop, which does directly help the understanding of 
the data set but communicates the overwhelming and cyclic nature of the Hollywood remakes 
phenomenon.
        </p>

        <h2>Successes and Failures of my Artifact</h2>

        <p>
            In terms of successes, I feel that my artifact manages to convey the clear narrative of the original 
films being better than the remakes. It also communicates well in its form the uninteresting and 
repressive nature of the remakes being produced. Doing a good job of showcasing its repetitiveness 
and boringness, and how that is antithetical to the film medium which is built for entertainment.
        </p>

        <p>
            In terms of failures, I believe I could have added more in terms of the concluding statements and 
featured a short review from an IMDB critic or user about the remake in comparison to the original. 
Which would give the viewer more information to explore in terms of the artifact.
