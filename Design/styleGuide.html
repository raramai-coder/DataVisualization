                <h2>Colours</h2>
                <p>I chose a light coral pink as the main
                background color because not only
                is it beautiful but it's desaturated
                enough to match with most colors
                which is important because the home
                page will contain a lot of movie posters
                with different colors on them.
                
                </p>
                <p>White works well as a contrast color to
                the pink as its bright enough to stand
                out but also not too jarring.</p>
                <p>The highlight color is a deeper hue of
                pink that stands out from the coral and
                allows objects to be differentiated
                from other objects on screen.</p>
                <p>I chose the purple for important
                elements that need to do more than
                stand out but must actively call the
                attention of the viewer. Important
                elements such as the button to go to
                the data visualisation page since this
                page is at the core of the purpose of
                this webste</p>

                <h2>Fonts</h2>
                <p>All headings are in Javanesse Text
                which is highly legible but stylised
                enough to stand out from the paragraph
                text and to bring out more character on
                the site as compared to using a standard
                font like Arial for example.
                </p>
                <p>Lato bold is used for paragraphs, it is also
                very legible but stylised enough to suit
                the aesthetic of the website. Which aims
                to be stylish in a minimalist but
                distinguishable way.</p>
                <p>Both fonts are dyslexia friendly and highly
                accessible.</p>

                <p>Elements encapsulate divs, buttons,
                etc.
                
                </p>
                <p>All elements, cards and images have
                rounded corners and a thin border that is
                a uniform light grey except in special cases.</p>
                <p>Cards have their border in the highlight
                color and have a small drop shadow.</p>

                <h2>Interaction</h2>
                <p>When the user hovers over the circle
                of an entry they should be able to get
                more information on the entry. Such as
                its movie title, whether it is a remake or
                an original and the IMDB rating it got.
        
                </p>
                <p>This will help users understand and read
                the data visualisation better. As well as
                give them access to the desired narrative
                better as the key information required
                to form that narrative will be readily
                given and highlighted to them.
                </p>

                <p>Lastly, the users should be able to press a
                button that shuffles the movies being
                shown in the visualisation to show them
                a new randomly selected set of movies.
                Having access to more movies will help
                the users understand that the pattern is
                across the board and not just on the
                movies selected for the visualisation.
